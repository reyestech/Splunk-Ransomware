</div>

üìù TL;DR
- Confirmed Cerber ransomware on the host we8105desk using Splunk SIEM data.
- Traced infection path: USB lure ‚Üí Word macro ‚Üí VBScript payload ‚Üí encryption ‚Üí lateral spread.
- Captured IoCs (IPs, hashes, filenames, registry keys) and documented detection, containment, and hardening.

Key skills:
> Splunk SPL queries, timeline reconstruction, process lineage, registry analysis, DNS filtering, IOC extraction, and IR playbook design.

## **Scenario**

After the excitement of yesterday, Alice has started to settle into her new job. Sadly, she realizes her new colleagues may not be the crack cybersecurity team she was led to believe before joining. Looking through her incident ticketing queue, she noticed a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù ticket was never addressed. Shaking her head, she begins to investigate. Apparently, on August 24th, Bob Smith (using a Windows 10 workstation named we8105desk) came back to his desk after working out and found his speakers blaring (click below to listen), his desktop image changed (see below) and his files inaccessible. Alice has seen this before... ransomware. After a quick conversation with Bob, Alice determines that Bob found a USB drive in the parking lot earlier in the day, plugged it into his desktop, and opened up a Word document on the USB drive called "Miranda_Tate_unveiled.dotm". With a resigned sigh, she begins to dig in.

## **Intro to the Ransomware**
### Your Assignment (Objectives)
The main goal of this lab is to confirm ransomware activity, trace how it entered the environment, and document the attacker‚Äôs path. As the SOC analyst, you must identify the infected host, understand the infection vector, and collect supporting evidence for containment and remediation. By following each step, you will gain experience with Splunk queries, correlation, and building repeatable workflows for incident response.
- Confirm Cerber encryption activity on the host we8105desk.
- Trace the attack path: USB ‚Üí macro ‚Üí payload ‚Üí encryption ‚Üí lateral spread.
- Identify key IoCs: IPs, filenames, hashes, domains.
- Document detection, containment, and hardening steps.
- Practice repeatable detection engineering.

### Evidence Artifacts
The attackers left behind artifacts to intimidate the victim and provide breadcrumbs for the investigation. These serve as both starting points and pivot material in Splunk.
- **Ransom note screenshot** on the desktop: **Screenshot**: https://botscontent.netlify.app/v1/cerber-sshot.png `Picture 1.1-Picture 1.2`
- **Voice memo warning**, designed to panic the user: **Voice Memo**: https://botscontent.netlify.app/v1/cerber-sample-voice.mp `Picture 1.3`
- **USB-delivered Word file:** Miranda_Tate_unveiled.dotm
- **Desktop wallpaper change** (visual indicator of infection).

## üõ†Ô∏è Hunt Setup & Pre-Engagement  
Before starting Splunk hunts, I staged my environment and outlined the necessary data sources for the investigation. This preparation ensured that the evidence could be safely reviewed, enriched, and then imported into Splunk for structured analysis.

**Prep Work (Safe Evidence Review):**  
- Used Windows Sandbox and Sandboxie-Plus to inspect the ransom screenshot and audio memo safely.
- Captured hashes, filenames, and metadata for enrichment using tools like VirusTotal and AlienVault OTX.
- Logged Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)‚Äîincluding IP addresses, Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs), hashes, and filenames‚Äîinto a scratchpad for later pivoting.

**Splunk Hunt Setup:**  
- **Time Window**: Aug 24, 2016 (00:00‚Äì23:59).  
- **Primary Host**: `we8105desk` (expected IP ‚âà `192.168.250.100`).  
- **Key Data Sources**:  
  - `stream:DNS` ‚Üí suspicious domains.  
  - `suricata` ‚Üí payload delivery.  
  - `XmlWinEventLog:Sysmon` ‚Üí process lineage + encryption activity.  
  - `winregistry` ‚Üí USB artifacts + persistence checks.  
- **Reference Artifacts**: ransom screenshot, audio memo, and USB-delivered file.  

**Pro Tips:**  
- Always lock the **time picker** before pivoting queries.  
- Use the **fields sidebar** for quick pivots (`src_ip`, `fileinfo.filename`, `ParentProcessId`).  
- Save useful queries as **Reports** ‚Üí convert to **Alerts** later.  
- Build a repeatable **IoC scratchpad** for rapid enrichment and correlation.  
> üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Happy Hunting!

## Ransomware 202 ‚Äî FQDN Used During Encryption
What fully qualified domain name (FQDN) does the Cerber ransomware attempt to direct the user to during its encryption phase? <br /> 
- Let's add a DNS filter to our query: "stream: DNS." We can use your IP address from 200 as the source IP. Enter Search: index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:DNS src_ip=192.168.250.100
- At this point, we see too many entries. We can start adding filters to the legitimate DNS requests. By using the "NOT query="
- We can add Queries to requests that could be for .local, .arpa, or standard websites. We see the IP addresses used, such as Microsoft's MSN. </b>
- You can use Google to compare & contrast requests you can add. - We can add "| table dest_ip _time query" to show the FQDNs for easier reading.
- I saw a suspicious FQDN. I opened it and found our suspect. Now that we had what we were looking for, I opened the event and had the attacker's information, date, and event time. I will save this Search and take a screenshot for future use.
- Enter Search: index=botsv1 sourcetype=stream:DNS src_ip=192.168.250.100 NOT query=*.local NOT query=*.arpa  NOT query=*.microsoft.com NOT query=*.msn.com NOT query=*.info query=*.*| table dest_ip _time query

## üîÑ **Recap ‚Äî Step by Step**
| Phase                     | Implementation                                                       | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bound the Window         | Mark first alert/user report + last known-good for `we8105desk`      | Keep searches tight and relevant          |
| Identify Patient-Zero    | Confirm host/IP (e.g., `we8105desk` ‚Üí `192.168.250.100`)             | Anchor the hunt to a single endpoint      |
| Early DNS Signals        | Timeline suspicious FQDNs (filter benign *.local/*.arpa/MS domains)  | Catch ransomware infra early              |
| Payload Delivery         | Correlate Suricata/HTTP ‚Üí cryptor fetch (e.g., `mhtr.jpg`)           | Prove how the encryptor arrived           |
| Process Lineage          | Sysmon chain (e.g., `VBScript ‚Üí 121214.tmp`, capture PPID)           | Tie execution to parent/child processes   |
| Encryption Signals       | Spikes in file creates/renames + new extensions in user profile      | Confirm active encryption on host         |
| Lateral Movement / SMB   | File-server access (e.g., `we9041srv`) + distinct files encrypted    | Measure spread and business impact        |
| Removable Media Evidence | WinRegistry artifacts (USB friendly name like `MIRANDA_PRI`)          | Validate initial vector (USB lure)        |
| Collect IoCs & Evidence  | FQDNs, IPs, hashes, filenames, screenshots, exact timestamps         | Support containment and post-mortems      |
| Contain & Recover        | Isolate host, block IoCs, disable accounts, restore from backups     | Stop spread and return to good state      |
| Harden                   | DNS egress rules, ASR/AppLocker, macro blocking, least-priv SMB      | Reduce recurrence / shrink attack surface |
| Operationalize           | Saved searches, alerts/dashboards, backup validation & runbook       | Make response repeatable and faster       |

## üìö **Lessons Learned**
- [ ] **Early DNS pays off:** Filtering benign domains surfaces ransomware infra quickly.  
     - DNS timelines gave first touchpoints before heavy encryption noise appeared.
- [ ] **Process lineage matters:** Parent/child chains cut through endpoint noise.  
     - VBS ‚Üí TMP ‚Üí encryptor established causality you can act on.
- [ ] **Velocity > volume:** Write-rate spikes + new extensions are high-signal.  
     - Baselines made the abnormal file creation jumps obvious.
- [ ] **Registry is gold for ingress:** USB artifacts confirmed the lure.  
     - Friendly-name keys tied the story together.
- [ ] **Quantify impact:** Distinct files encrypted on shares guide triage/comms.  
     - Counts per host/share prioritize isolation and recovery.
- [ ] **Repeatability wins:** Turn ad-hoc hunts into alerts/dashboards & RBA.  
     - Codifying detections shrinks MTTR and improves consistency.
- [ ] **Evidence discipline:** IoCs + screenshots + exact times enable audits & clean handoffs.  
     - Makes IR documentation and lessons-learned actionable.

## **Conclusion**
This lab turns a messy outbreak into a timeline of compromise ‚Üí containment ‚Üí hardening. By correlating DNS, Suricata, Sysmon, and Registry artifacts, we identified patient-zero, traced payload delivery, measured impact on the file server, and produced repeatable detections.

The same rhythm applies in production: observe ‚Üí correlate ‚Üí validate ‚Üí harden. Practicing it here builds the muscle memory to respond faster when the stakes are real.

Next: Extend to Risk-Based Alerting (weight DNS + write spikes + lineage) and add SOAR actions for rapid isolation and backup validation.
